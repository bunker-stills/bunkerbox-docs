The BunkerBox industrial controller utilizes the RED Brick microcontroller from TinkerForge. More information on the RED Brick can be found at https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricks/RED_Brick.html#red-brick.

The RED Brick utilizes an RTOS running Debian Linux, and full instructions for installing the OS can be found at https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricks/RED_Brick.html#red-brick-images.

To install the firmware, you will need the following items:

- A Micro-SD card with at least 8GB of space.
- A USB 2.0 Mini-B cable.
